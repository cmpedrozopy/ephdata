# ephdata
Data from 1998 to 2020 of the Paraguayan EPH (Encuesta Permanente de Hogares). The EPH is an annual household survey. The National Institute of Statistics (INE, in Spanish) from Paraguay makes the data public on their website. But, data from each year is on a different file. For instance, in order to make a cross-period analysis between 2005 and 2009, one will have to download the information for each year. Hence, analyzing the data from survey to survey becomes a tedious task. To overcome this, I grouped the data from the first survey to the 2020. The variables I included are age, sex, income, among others. This file is useful to analyze the evolution over the years of income distribution, poverty, middle class, etc. Besides, it is particular helpful to extend the analysis over more variables - for instance, I plan to add new information about education, health, and employment. Thus, analyzing these variables using just one data set is more efficient for the researcher.
