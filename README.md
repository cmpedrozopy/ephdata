# ephdata
This file contents data  of the Paraguayan EPH (Encuesta Permanente de Hogares) from 1998 to 2020. 
The EPH is an annual household survey. The National Institute of Statistics (INE, in Spanish) from Paraguay makes the data public on their website. 
But, data from each year is on a different file. 
For instance, in order to make a cross-period analysis between 2005 and 2009, one will have to download the information for each year. 

Hence, analyzing the data from survey to survey becomes a tedious task. To overcome this, I grouped the data from the first survey to the 2020. 
The variables I included in this dataset are age, sex, income, among others. This file is useful to analyze the evolution over the years of income distribution, poverty, middle class, etc. 
Besides, it is particular helpful to extend the analysis to more variables - for example, I plan to add new information about education, health, and employment. 
Thus, analyzing these variables using just one data set is more efficient for the researcher.

The append of this dataset was a challenge task. In particular, the names of variables change from survey to survey. For instance, the name of the variable identifying "Others sources of income" in 2010 was e01jde - in 2011 it was e01lde.
Besides, from one to another survey there are new variables in the data set.
The content of the labels also changes and is not the same in all the surveys.
As a consequence, it is quite easy and difficult to notice if the resulting data set is wrong.
Hence, manual tasks and quality check is crucial.
If any inconsistency is suspected, please send an email.
